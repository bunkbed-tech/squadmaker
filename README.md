# squadmaker

squadmaker helps team captains build and organize an intramural sports squad

Create your league and add your friends. Everyone can then concurrently log games, add scores, and generate stat summaries.

## Details

This project has been abandoned for the time being as we focus on getting our other ideas off the ground.

Currently, we have a basic data model and database. The UI is only implemented for Android and it doesn't hoook into the database just yet.

### Tools

- Rust: backend
- Kotlin MPM: frontend logic
- Jetpack Compose: Android UI
- SwiftUI: iOS UI

## Testing

Run `docker-compose up --build` from `./backend` to run all of the tests in development.
